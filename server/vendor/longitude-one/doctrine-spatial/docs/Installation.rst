Installation
============

Installation via composer
-------------------------

Add the `longitude-one/doctrine-spatial` package in your composer.json.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ composer require longitude-one/doctrine-spatial

Or you can edit directly `composer.json` file by adding this line on your requirements:

.. code-block:: javascript

    "require": {
    	...
        "longitude-one/doctrine-spatial": "^3.0"

Be careful, the version 3.0.0 will only be available during summer 2021.

Installation without composer
-----------------------------

If you're not using composer, you can
:download:`download the library  <https://github.com/longitude-one/doctrine-spatial/archive/master.zip>`.
Then copy and paste the lib directory where you store all libraries of your application.
